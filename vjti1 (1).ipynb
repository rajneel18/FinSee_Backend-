by cutting back on nonessential purchases here , you might find more disposable funds available elsewhere in your monthly budget toward paying off any high interest rate debt balances , which would then free up even greater sums over time due to compounding effects of being unencumbered by those burdensome obligations while still maintaining sufficient funds for all other necessary living expenditures . last but not least , perhaps most importantly given today's market conditions , now would also seem like an excellent time to review overall asset allocation strategy since stock market volatility tends typically increase demand among conservative investors seeking higher yields from fixed income instruments versus equity exposure at times when prices appear relatively expensive compared against historical norms. by regularly rebalancing portfolio holdings according to these principles during periods of heightened uncertainty , clients tend to benefit substantially long term due mostly directly correlated moves between bond returns relative to equities during times where one class outperforms significantly versus normal cycles observed throughout each respective asset class cycle across markets worldwide throughout our observation period . finally , as part of this comprehensive process , it would certainly help us identify any potential pitfalls that might occur if client assets were concentrated primarily within particular segments such as large cap growth companies whose performance can vary greatly depending upon factors outside their control whereas diversification generally mitigates risks associated with concentration problems arising mainly from idiosyncratic events impacting only certain sectors/companies rather than broad macroeconomic factors affecting many assets simultaneously . so don't hesitate contacting us whenever changes occur within either one aspect listed above;
